<p>  On test day, bring a face covering and wear it as directed by the test center. Remember to also practice social distancing at all times.
Be prepared to answer questions about your health prior to entering the test center. If you feel sick the day of your test, please stay home and contact customer service for your options. You won’t be charged a change or cancellation fee if you stay home due to illness.

<h3>
What to Bring on the Test Day? </h3>
<p>There are only a few things you really need to bring on test day, and a lot of things you'll be better off leaving at home. Be sure to bring:</p>
  <ul>
     <li>Face covering</li>
      <li>Your up-to-date admission ticket</li>
       <li>Acceptable photo ID</li>
        <li>Two No. 2 pencils with erasers</li>
         <li>Face covering</li>

   <li>An approved calculator </li>
  <li>  Epinephrine auto-injectors (e.g., EpiPens) are permitted without the need for accommodations. They must be placed in a clear bag and stored under the student’s desk during testing. For policies on other medications and medical devices, contact Services for Students with Disabilities. </li>
  
  </ul>
<br>
<h3>It's also nice to have...</h3><br>
<ul>

 <li>A watch (without an audible alarm)</li>
 <li>Extra batteries and backup equipment—you’ll have to ask for permission to access them. They cannot be on your desk during the test.</li>
 <li>A bag or backpack</li>
 <li>A drink or snacks (for your break)</li>
 <li>Breakfast before you arrive</li>

</ul>
<br>

 <h3> Turn Off All Electronic Devices </h3>

<p>
You’ll need to turn off all electronic devices during the test, even during breaks. This includes cellphones. Be sure to turn off your watch alarm, if you have one.
Why? Test centers are serious about security and quiet, so prohibited devices—which include cellphones, tablets, and MP3 players—must be turned off and put under your desk. Better yet: Leave them at home.
If You Bring or Use Prohibited Devices
The test administration staff is encouraged to collect and hold phones and other prohibited electronic devices during the test administration, including break periods, or to deny admission to anyone who is in possession of a prohibited electronic device.
If your device makes noise or you are seen using it at any time, including during breaks, you may be dismissed immediately, your scores can be canceled, and the device may be confiscated and its contents inspected. The College Board is not responsible for loss or damage to personal items, including electronic devices, while you are in the test center.
